# ProdTech

ProdTech is a web application designed to assist small startups and companies in generating basic design ideas for their products. By utilizing advanced AI models, it takes user input in text format and converts it into a structured prompt. This prompt is then passed to the Segmind API, which employs the stable Diffusion Model Colossus Lightning SDXL to generate images of the envisioned products.

## Features

- **Text-to-Prompt Conversion**: Convert user-provided text input into a structured prompt suitable for generating product design ideas.
- **AI Image Generation**: Utilize the Segmind API with the Colossus Lightning SDXL model to generate images based on the provided prompt.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: User-friendly web interface for seamless interaction and input submission.
